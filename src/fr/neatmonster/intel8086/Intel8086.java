/**
 * The 8086 CPU is characterized by:
 * - a standard operating speed of 5 MHz (200 ns a cycle time).
 * - chips housed in reliable 40-pin packages.
 * - a processor that operates on both 8- and 16-bit data types.
 * - up to 1 megabyte of memory that can be addressed, along with a separate
 * 64k byte I/O space.
 *
 * CPU Architecture
 *
 * CPU incorporates two separate processing units; the Execution Unit or "EU"
 * and the Bus Interface Unit or "BIU". The BIU for the 8086 incorporates a
 * 16-bit data bus and a 6-byte instruction queue.
 *
 * The EU is responsible for the execution of all instructions, for providing
 * data and addresses to the BIU, and for manipulating the general registers
 * and the flag register. Except for a few control pins, the EU is completely
 * isolated from the "outside world." The BIU is responsible for executing all
 * external bus cycles and consists of the segment and communication registers,
 * the instruction pointer and the instruction object code queue. The BIU
 * combines segment and offset values in its dedicated adder to derive 20-bit
 * addresses, transfers data to and from the EU on the ALU data bus and loads
 * or "prefetches" instructions into the queue from which they are fetched by
 * the EU.
 *
 * The EU, when it is ready to execute an instruction, fetches the instruction
 * object code byte from the BIU's instruction queue and then executes the
 * instruction. If the queue is empty when the EU is ready to fetch an
 * instruction byte, the EU waits for the instruction byte to be fetched. In
 * the course of instruction execution, if a memory location or I/O port must
 * be accessed, the EU requests the BIU to perform the required bus cycle.
 *
 * The two processing sections of the CPU operate independently. In the 8086
 * CPU, when two or more bytes of the 6-byte instruction queue are empty and
 * the EU does not require the BIU to perform a bus cycle, the BIU executes
 * instruction fetch cycles to refill the queue. Note that the 8086 CPU, since
 * it has a 16-bit data bus, can access two instructions object code bytes in a
 * single bus cycle. If the EU issues a request for bus access while the BIU is
 * in the process of an instruction fetch bus cycle, the BIU completes the
 * cycle before honoring the EU's request.

     * Memory
     *
     * The 8086 can accommodate up to 1,048,576 bytes of memory in both minimum
     * and maximum mode. This section describes how memory is functionally
     * organized and used.
     *
     * Storage Organization
     *
     * From a storage point of view, the 8086 memory space is organized as an
     * array of 8-bit bytes. Instructions, byte data and word data may be
     * freely stored at any byte address without regard for alignment thereby
     * saving memory space by allowing code to be densely packed in memory.
     * Odd-addressed (unaligned) word variables, however, do not take advantage
     * of the 8086's ability to transfer 16-bits at a time. Instruction
     * alignment does not materially affect the performance of the processor.
     *
     * Following Intel convention, word data always is stored with the most-
     * significant byte in the higher memory location. Most of the time this
     * storage convention is "invisible" to anyone working with the processors;
     * exceptions may occur when monitoring the system bus or when reading
     * memory dumps.
     *
     * A special class of data is stored as doublewords; i.e., two consecutive
     * words. These are called pointers and are used to address data and code
     * that are outside the currently-addressable segments. The lower-addressed
     * word of a pointer contains an offset value, and the higher-addressed
     * word contains a segment base address. Each word is stored conventionally
     * with the higher-addressed byte containing the most significant eight
     * bits of the word.
     *
     * Segmentation
     *
     * 8086 programs "view" the megabyte of memory space as a group of segments
     * that are defined by the application. A segment is a logical unit of
     * memory that may be up to 64k bytes long. Each segment is made up of
     * contiguous memory locations and is an independent, separately-
     * addressable unit. Every segment is assigned (by software) a base
     * address, which is its starting location in the memory space. All
     * segments begin on 16-byte memory boundaries. There are no other
     * restrictions on segment locations; segments may be adjacent, disjoint,
     * partially overlapped, or fully overlapped. A physical memory location
     * may be mapped into (contained in) one or more logical segments.
     *
     * The segment registers point to (contain the vase address values of) the
     * four currently addressable segments. Programs obtain access to code and
     * data in other segments by changing the segment registers to point to the
     * desired segments.
     *
     * Every application will define and use segments differently. The
     * currently addressable segments provide a generous work space: 64k bytes
     * for code, a 64k byte stack and 128k bytes of data storage. Many
     * applications can be written to simply initialize the segments registers
     * and then forget them. Larger applications should be designed with
     * careful consideration given to segment definition.
     *
     * The segmented structure of the 8086 memory space supports modular
     * software design by discouraging huge, monolithic programs. The segments
     * also can be used to advantage in many programming situations. Take, for
     * example, the case of an editor for several on-line terminals. A 64k text
     * buffer (probably an extra segment) could be assigned to each terminal. A
     * single program could maintain all the buffers by simply changing
     * register ES to point to the buffer of the terminal requesting service.
     *
     * Physical Address Generation
     *
     * It is useful to think of every memory location as having two kinds of
     * addresses, physical and logical. A physical address is the 20-bit value
     * that uniquely identifies each byte location in the megabyte memory
     * space. Physical addresses may range from 0H through FFFFFH. All
     * exchanges between the CPU and memory components use this physical
     * address.
     *
     * Programs deal with logical, rather than physical addresses and allow
     * code to be developed without prior knowledge of where the code is to be
     * located in memory and facilitate dynamic management of memory resources.
     * A logical address consists of a segment base value and an offset value.
     * For any given memory location, the segment base value locate the first
     * byte of the containing segment and the offset value is the distance, in
     * bytes, of the target location from the beginning of the segment. Segment
     * base and offset values are unsigned 16-bit quantities; the lowest-
     * addressed byte in a segment has an offset of 0. Many different logical
     * addresses can map to the same physical location.
     *
     * Whenever the BIU accesses memory--to fetch an instruction or to obtain
     * or store a variable--it generates a physical address from a logical
     * address. This is done by shifting the segment base value four bit
     * positions and adding the offset. Note that this addition process
     * provides for modulo 64k addressing (addresses wrap around from the end
     * of a segment to the beginning of the same segment).
     *
     * The BIU obtains the logical address of a memory location from different
     * sources depending on the type of reference that is being made.
     * Instructions always are fetched from the current code segment; IP
     * contains the offset of the target instruction from the beginning of the
     * segment. Stack instructions always operate on the current stack segment;
     * SP contains the offset of the top of the stack. Most variables (memory
     * operands) are assumed to reside in the current data segment, although a
     * program can instruct the BIU to access a variable in one of the other
     * currently addressable segments. The offset of a memory variable is
     * calculated by the EU. This calculation is based on the addressing mode
     * specified in the instruction, the result is called the operand's
     * effective address (EA).
     *
     * In most cases, the BIU's segment assumptions are a convenience to
     * programmers. It is possible, however, for a programmer to explicitly
     * direct the BIU to access a variable in any of the currently addressable
     * segments (the only exception is the destination operand of a string
     * instruction which must be in the extra segment). This is done by
     * preceding an instruction with a segment override prefix. This one-byte
     * machine instruction tells the BIU which segment register to use to
     * access a variable referenced in the following instruction.
     *
     * Dedicated and Reserved Memory Locations
     *
     * Two areas in extreme low and high memory are dedicated to specific
     * processor functions or are reserved by Intel Corporation for use by
     * Intel hardware and software products. The locations are: 0H through 7FH
     * (128 bytes) and FFFF0H through FFFFFH (16 bytes). These areas are used
     * for interrupt and system reset processing; 8086 application systems
     * should not use these areas for any other purpose. Doing so may make
     * these systems incompatible with future Intel products.

         * Arithmetic Instructions
         *
         * Arithmetic Data Formats
         *
         * 8086 arithmetic operations may be performed on four types of
         * numbers: unsigned binary, signed binary (integers), unsigned packed
         * decimal and unsigned unpacked decimal. Binary numbers may be 8 or 16
         * bits long. Decimal numbers are stored in bytes, two digits per byte
         * for packed decimals and one digit per byte for unpacked decimal. The
         * processor always assumes that the operands specified in arithmetic
         * instructions contain data that represents valid numbers for the type
         * of instructions being performed. Invalid data may produce
         * unpredictable results.
         *
         * Unsigned binary numbers may be either 8 or 16 bits long; all bits
         * are considered in determining a number's magnitude. The value range
         * of an 8-bit unsigned binary number is 0-255; 16 bits can represent
         * values from 0 through 65,535. Addition, subtraction, multiplication
         * and division operations are available for unsigned binary numbers.
         *
         * Signed binary numbers (integer) may be either 8 or 16 bits long. The
         * high-order (leftmost) bit is interpreted as the number's sign: 0 =
         * positive and 1 = negative. Negative numbers are represented in
         * standard two's complement notation. Since the high-order is used for
         * a sign, the range of an 8-bit integer is -128 through +127; 16-bit
         * integer may range from -32,768 through +32,767. The value zero has a
         * positive sign. Multiplication and division operations are provided
         * for signed binary numbers. Addition and subtraction are performed
         * with the unsigned binary instructions. Conditional jump
         * instructions, as well as an "interrupt on overflow" instruction, can
         * be used following an unsigned operation on an integer to detect
         * overflow into the sign bit.
         *
         * Packed decimal numbers are stored as unsigned byte quantities. The
         * byte is treated as having one decimal digit in each half-byte
         * (nibble); the digit in the high-order half-byte is the most
         * significant. Hexadecimal values 0-9 are valid in each half-byte, and
         * the range of a packed decimal number is 0-99. Addition and
         * subtraction are performed in two steps. First an unsigned binary
         * instruction is used to produce an intermediate result in register
         * AL. The an adjustment operation is performed which changes the
         * intermediate value in AL to a final correct packed decimal result.
         * Multiplication and division adjustments are not available for packed
         * decimal numbers.
         *
         * Unpacked decimal numbers are stored as unsigned byte quantities. The
         * magnitude of the number is determined from the low-order half-byte;
         * hexadecimal values 0-9 are valid and are interpreted as decimal
         * numbers. The high-order half-byte must be zero for multiplication
         * and division; it may contain any value from addition and
         * subtraction. Arithmetic on unpacked decimal numbers is performed in
         * two steps. The unsigned binary addition, subtraction and
         * multiplication operations are used to produce an intermediate result
         * in register AL. An adjustment instruction then changes the value in
         * AL to a final correct unpacked decimal number. Division is performed
         * similarly, except that the adjustment is carried out on the
         * numerator operand in register AL first, then a following unsigned
         * binary division instruction produces a correct result.
         *
         * Unpacked decimal numbers are similar to the ASCII character
         * representations of the digits 0-9. Note, however, that the high-
         * order half-byte of an ASCII numeral is always 3H. Unpacked decimal
         * arithmetic may be performed on ASCII number characters under the
         * following conditions:
         * - the high-order half-byte of an ASCII numeral must be set to 0H
         * prior to multiplication or division.
         * - unpacked decimal arithmetic leaves the high-order half-byte set to
         * 0H; it must be set to 3H to produce a valid ASCII numeral.
         *
         * Arithmetic Instructions and Flags
         *
         * The 8086 arithmetic instructions post certain characteristics of the
         * result of the operation to six flags. Most of these flags can be
         * tested by following the arithmetic instruction with a conditional
         * jump instruction; the INTO (interrupt on overflow) instruction may
         * also be used. The various instructions affect the flags differently,
         * as explained in the instruction descriptions.

         * instructions are presently being fetched. The IP is used as an
         * offset from the beginning of the code segment; the combination of CS
         * and IP points to the memory location from which the next instruction
         * is to be fetched. (Recall that under most operating conditions, the
         * next instruction to be executed has already been fetched from memory
         * and is waiting in the CPU instruction queue.) The program transfer
         * instructions operate on the instruction pointer and on the CS
         * register; changing the content of these causes normal sequential

         * next instruction from memory using the new IP and CS values, passes
         * the instruction directly to the EU, and then begins refilling the
         * queue from the new location.
         *
         * Four groups of program transfers are available in the 8086:
         * unconditional transfers, conditional transfers, iteration control
         * instructions and interrupt-related instructions. Only the interrupt-
         * related instruction affect any CPU flags. As will be seen, however,

         * or from a memory location or register referenced by the instruction
         * (indirect CALL). In the following descriptions, bear in mind that

         * position independent (dynamically relocatable) routines in which the
         * CALL and its target are in the same segment and are moved together.
         *
         * An intrasegment indirect CALL may be made through memory or through

     * Gets the effective address of the operand.
     *
     * The Effective Address
     *
     * The offset that the EU calculates for a memory operands is called the
     * operand's effective address or EA. It is an unsigned 16-bit number that
     * expresses the operand's distance in bytes from the beginning of the
     * segment in which it resides. The EU can calculate the effective address
     * in different ways. Information encoded in the second byte of the
     * instruction tells the EU how to calculate the operand. A compiler or
     * assembler derives this information from the statement or instruction
     * written by the programmer. Assembly language programmers have access to
     * all addressing modes.
     *
     * The execution unit calculate the EA by summing a displacement, the
     * content of a base register and the content of an index register. The
     * fact that any combination of these three given components may be present
     * in a given instruction gives rise to the variety of 8086 memory
     * addressing modes.
     *
     * The displacement element is a 8- or 16-bit number that is contained in
     * the instruction. The displacement generally is derived from the position
     * of the operand name (a variable or label) in the program. It also is
     * possible for a programmer to modify this value or to specify the
     * displacement explicitly.
     *
     * A programmer may specify that either BX or BP is to serve as a base
     * register whose content is to be used in the EA computation. Similarly,
     * either SI or DI may be specified as in index register. Whereas the
     * displacement value is a constant, the contents of the base and index
     * registers may change during execution. This makes it possible for one
     * instruction to access different memory locations as determined by the
     * current values in the base and/or index registers.
     *
     * It takes time for the EU to calculate a memory operand's effective
     * address. In general, the more elements in the calculation, the longer it
     * takes.
     *
     * Direct Addressing
     *
     * Direct addressing is the simplest memory addressing mode. No registers
     * are involved; the EA is take directly from the displacement field of the
     * instruction. Direct addressing typically is used to access simple
     * variables (scalars).
     *
     * Register Indirect Addressing
     *
     * The effective address of a memory operand may be taken directly from one
     * of the base or index register. One instruction can operate on many
     * different memory locations if the value in the base or index register is
     * updated appropriately. The LEA (load effective address) and arithmetic
     * instructions might be used to change the register value.
     *
     * Note that any 16-bit general register may be used for register indirect
     * addressing with the JMP or CALL instructions.
     *
     * Based Addressing
     *
     * In based addressing, the effective address is the sum of displacement
     * value and the content of register BX or register BP. Recall that
     * specifying BP as a base register directs the BIU to obtain the operand
     * from the current stack segment (unless a segment override prefix is
     * present). This makes based addressing with BP a very convenient way to
     * access stack data.
     *
     * Based addressing also provides a straightforward way to address
     * structures which may be located at different places in memory. A base
     * register can be pointed at the base of the structure and elements of the
     * structure addressed by their displacement from the base. Different
     * copies of the same structure can be accessed by simply changing the base
     * register.
     *
     * Indexed Addressing
     *
     * In indexed addressing, the effective address is calculated from the sum
     * of a displacement plus the content of an index register (SI or DI).
     * Indexed addressing often is used to access elements in an array. The
     * displacement locates the beginning of the array, and the value of the
     * index register selects one element (the first element is selected if the
     * index register contains 0). Since all array elements are the same
     * length, simple arithmetic on the index register will select any element.
     *
     * Based Indexed Addressing
     *
     * Based indexed addressing generates an effective address that is the sum
     * of a base register, an index register and a displacement. Based indexed
     * addressing is a very flexible ode because two address components can be
     * varied at execution time.
     *
     * Based indexed addressing provides a convenient way for a procedure to
     * address an array allocated on a stack. Register BP can contain the
     * offset of a reference point on the stack, typically the top of the stack
     * after the procedure has saved registers and allocated local storage. The
     * offset of the beginning of the array from the reference point can be
     * expressed by a displacement value, and an index register can be used to
     * access individual array elements.
     *
     * Arrays contained in structures and matrices (two-dimension arrays) also
     * could be accessed with base indexed addressing.
     *
     * String Addressing
     *
     * String instructions do not use the normal memory addressing modes to
     * access their operands. Instead, the index registers are used implicitly.
     * When a string instruction is executed, SI is assumed to point to the
     * first byte or word of the source string, and DI is assumed to point to
     * the first byte or word of the destination string. In a repeated string
     * operation, the CPU automatically adjusts SI and DI to obtain subsequent
     * bytes or words.
     *
     * I/O Port Addressing
     *
     * If an I/O port is memory mapped, any of the memory operand addressing
     * modes may be used to access the port. For example, a group of terminals
     * can be accessed as an "array". String instructions also can be used to
     * transfer data to memory-mapped ports with an appropriate hardware
     * interface.
     *
     * Two different addressing modes can be used to access ports located in
     * the I/O space. In direct port accessing, the port number is an 8-bit
     * immediate operand. This allows fixed access to ports numbered 0-255.
     * Indirect port addressing is similar to register indirect addressing of
     * memory operands. The port number is taken from register DX and can range
     * from 0 to 65,535. By previously adjusting the content of register DX,
     * one instruction can access any port in the I/O space. A group of
     * adjacent ports can be accessed using a simple software loop that adjusts
     * the value in DX.
